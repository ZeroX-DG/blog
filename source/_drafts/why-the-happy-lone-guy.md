You may be wondering: "why the name the happy lone guy?". Well, this post explains the origin of the name of this blog.

I intented this blog to be a place where I can express myself, to stay true to myself before I walk through my door and put on mask to "fit in" with everyone else in the society. It's not that I don't like society, I worry that society won't like me. People call my fear is society anxiety, I got no idea if I really have that mental illness or this is just a temporary state of mind of a teenager.

But since social anxiety keep me inside my house and I don't really know how to talk to people so I normally alone with my thoughts even with people around me. However my thoughts are not always positive, in fact, most of them are negative. Thus, the name "happy" lone guy suppose to keep me on the right track for this blog and for my life. It should remind me that I can be alone but I have to learn to be happy because sadness come to us to show us happiness.

Now you know how I picked the name for this blog and what the blog is about, enter my world at your own risk :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
