Although I'm not movie buffs like Theo or Isabelle from the great movie "The Dreamers" by Bernardo Bertolucci, the world of cinema has hugely influenced the way I live my life. "Fight Club" by David Fincher has always been one of the most significant contributing factors that {% post_link Nihilism converted me into a nihilist. %} The vengeance trilogy by Park Chan-wook has showed me how ugly yet beautiful human true nature can be, and how wrong you are when judging people on their dark side like in "Death Parade" by Yuzuru Tachikawa. But the show that influenced the most to who I am today is Mr. Robot.

Written and directed by the genius Sam Esmail, Mr. Robot features Elliot Alderson-a cyber security engineer by day and a vigilante hacker by night.
