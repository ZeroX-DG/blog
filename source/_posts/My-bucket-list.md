This is just a ordinary bucket list of mine :smile: <!--more--> In the future, I may be depressed thinking about I haven't done anything on the list yet or I'll laugh at myself for wanting things that are so simple and childish.

- [ ] 1. Have at least 3 products that can change the world.
- [ ] 2. Travel to Europe and study about the countries there.
- [ ] 3. Teach in a class.
- [ ] 4. Learn how to play an instrument.

- [ ] 7. Write at least 1 book.
- [ ] 8. Create a ~~cult~~ group of friends to do crazy stuff both online & offline
