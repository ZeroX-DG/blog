I was going through my old notes when I found a bunch of poems that I wrote last year. I occasionally write poems just to offload whatever was on my mind, so these poems are normally sad, and unpolished.

Many of my poems used to feel like a series of inside jokes with myself so I always delete them after writing. But now, I think I want to start saving these poems somewhere as some poetic snapshots of my life.

I was very much inspired by the haiku in 2024 as you can see :joy:

## Dust

<poem>Before my eyes,
dust gathered on my glasses.
What else am I not seeing?
</poem>

<br>
<br>

## It's done

<poem>What done is done.
What should have been done,
is always a dream.
</poem>

<br>
<br>

## Where dreams come to die
<poem>In the pit of exhaustion,
where dreams come to die,
I see myself curled up,
too tired to cry.
</poem>

<br>

## Drunk
<poem>When I'm drunk, life is simple.
Sadness is simple,
so is happiness.
And at the bottom of my glass
I'll find you,
where my happiness and sadness
become one.
I'll take another sip,
when you're not here.
Let it burn down my throat,
my swirling laughters, and silent tears.
</poem>

## Breadcrumbs
<poem>All I remember,
was the sunny kitchen,
	the breeze snuck in
	through the curtains.
And your lingering laughter
like half-forgotten dreams,
like the breadcrumbs
    you left
    on the counter.
</poem>
