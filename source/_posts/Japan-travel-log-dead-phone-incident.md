I started 2025 by fulfilling my ultimate dream since I was 17: to become a tourist in Japan :omg: With my Hiragana memorised (no Dakuon), some basic phrases for greeting, thanking, asking where the toilet is, and a thick concoction of Kiwi, British, American & Vietnamese accent in my throat, I packed my suitcase and head out for Japan. This is my attempt to record my fading memory of the trip.

*I spent most of my time reading this on my flight to Tokyo.*

## First Impressions

I landed at Narita airport around 5 PM to pleasantly cool weather—surprisingly similar to Auckland, at least to me. I caught the train to Ueno Station, and one line from Murakami’s _Norwegian Wood_ kept echoing in my head:

**"Ticket, Midori, please. Ueno Station."**

That sort of thing kept happening throughout the trip. I’d wander down some street, spot a random sign or building, and suddenly my mind would flood with film scenes, book passages, or knowledge about past events—anything remotely connected. I was living my weeaboo dream to the fullest :omg:

Stepping out of the train station, I immediately overwhelmed by Tokyo's chaotic welcome. There was people everywhere. And I mean *everywhere*. There were people at every corner, walking and laughing and leaning against the walls of high rise buildings. But it's really the sound that pushed me into sensory overload. The rumble of trains running overhead, the occasional "irasshaimase" & "gochisousama desu" from the restaurants near by, and those little jingles that plays every time a konbini door slides open.

This gave me a sudden rush of energy, so I decided to walk to my AirBnB instead of taking the train. This was my very first mistake on this trip :laughing:

## The Dead Phone Incident

About ten minutes into my walk, I glanced at my phone, my battery level was at 6% and I was about 25 minutes walk away from my AirBnB. Panic instantly set in. Countless thoughts started popping up:

"This is your first solo trip. You don't know anyone here. You can't call anyone because your phone is about to die. And you don't even know where your hotel is."

"But hey, something is going wrong. And that is good."

It was that last thought that put me at ease. To have something unexpected happens on my trip was my #1 priority. It's always the unexpected that gave you the best stories to tell. I would be massively disappointed if nothing went wrong on my first solo trip. And so I was back in problem solving mode in just a few seconds.

I used the last of my battery finding my way to a Family Mart nearby. It was around 8:40 PM at the time. The two girls in uniform greeted me from behind the counter. I asked them if they can charge my phone and luckily they said yes (after some hesitating). I bought a bottle of tea and a Melonpan to eat outside. A cool wind rushed down the empty street of Asakusa. I stood there, eating my first meal in Japan, feeling the sweetness spreading across my body.....the tea was a bit bitter tho. It didn't really go with the Melonpan. Not recommended.

I left [a review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/USdVFFVHb8TSUUSK9) for those two girls on google map, hopefully they'll get a raise or something, wherever they are working right now...
