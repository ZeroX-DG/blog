You may be wondering: "why the name the happy lone guy?". Well, this post explains the origin of the name of this blog.

The concept behind the name "happy lone guy" is I'm an introvert who has social anxiety, therefore, I spent most of my time being alone in my room. With all the time on this world to be alone, I used them to think about the nature/philosophy of everything and decided to make a blog to express all those thoughts.

One of the drawbacks of this method of thinking is most of the things you think about are negative things. Therefore, to cope with depression, I'll have to seek for happiness in those negative thoughts. That's why I'm a "happy lone guy".

The job of this life is to deliver negative things to human, so they can understand happiness. If life has already given you negative things and you refuse to seek for happiness, life will make sure that you do that, this life or another.
