You may be wondering: "why the name the happy lone guy?". Well, this post explains the origin of the name of this blog.

<!-- more -->

The concept behind the name "happy lone guy" is I'm an introvert living with social anxiety. Thus, I spent most of my time being alone in my room. With all the time on this world to be alone, I used them to think about the nature/philosophy of everything and decided to make a blog to express all those thoughts.

One of the drawbacks of this method of thinking is most of the things you think about are negative things and your will easily get depress because of it. Therefore, to cope with depression, I'll have to seek for happiness in those negative thoughts. That's why I'm a "happy lone guy".

I believe that the job of this life is to deliver negative things to human, so they can understand happiness. There's no happiness if there's no unhappiness, there's no day if there's no night. I'm still exploring the true feeling of happiness and this will be the document of my adventure :smile:
